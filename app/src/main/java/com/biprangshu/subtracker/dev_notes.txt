Things to do after the intial lookup of the app:
1. Implement user authentication (sign up, login, logout).
2. Add functionality to track subscriptions (add, edit, delete).
3. Create a database to store user data and subscriptions. Update the data tracks which is now used to store static data.
4. Idea to dynamically fetch the logo from url instead of storing it in the app:
    - The basic idea of the implementation is to when the user searches for the subscription name, this will be sent to logo fetching API (Logo.dev) to download the logo image.
    - The fetched logo image will be stored in the local storage of the app against that subscription entry.
    - Whenever the subscription details are displayed, the app will first check if a logo image is available in the local storage. If available, it will load the logo from there; otherwise, it will display a default placeholder image.
