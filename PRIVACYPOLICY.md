# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** January 29, 2026

SubTracker ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose your information when you use our Android application (the "App").

## 1. Information We Collect
To provide a comprehensive subscription tracking experience, we process the following types of information:

* **Subscription Data:** We process details about the subscriptions you add, such as name, price, billing cycle, and due dates. **This data is stored locally on your device.**
* **Usage Data:** We use **Firebase Analytics** to collect anonymous usage data (e.g., screen views, button clicks) to help us improve the App's performance and user experience.
* **Device Information:** We may collect device-specific information (e.g., model, OS version) for analytics and crash reporting.

**We do not collect or store your personal contact information (such as email or phone number) or create user accounts.**

## 2. How We Use Your Information
We use the information for the following purposes:
* **Core Functionality:** To store and display your subscription portfolio and calculate spending totals.
* **AI Insights:** To provide "Burn Rate" calculations and spending optimization tips using **Google Gemini**.
* **Notifications:** To schedule local reminders for upcoming payments.
* **Security:** To enable Biometric Authentication (Fingerprint/Face Unlock) if you choose to activate it.

## 3. Data Storage and Processing
* **Local Storage:** All your subscription data, preferences, and custom settings are stored **locally** on your device using an encrypted database. We do not transmit this data to any external sync server.
* **AI Processing:** When using AI features (e.g., Optimization, Burn Rate), specific subscription details (Name, Price, Currency) are securely sent to **Google Gemini** for processing. This data is not used to train Google's models and is transient.
* **Biometric Data:** If you enable Biometric Lock, the App relies on your device's system-level authentication. We **never** access or store your actual fingerprint or face data.

## 4. Third-Party Services
The App interacts with the following third-party services:

* **Google Gemini (AI):** Used for generating spending insights and optimization suggestions.
* **Firebase Analytics:** Used to collect anonymous usage statistics.

## 5. Your Rights and Choices
* **Data Control:** You have full control over your data. You can add, edit, or delete subscriptions within the App at any time.
* **Data Erasure:** Since data is stored locally, uninstalling the App or clearing its data via Android Settings will permanently remove all your stored information.
* **Opt-Out:** You can disable specific features like Biometric Security in the App Settings.

## 6. Children's Privacy
Our App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

## 7. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the repository and updated with a new effective date.
